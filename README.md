This is a simple neural network designed to classify pictures into two classes: ones that contain a face and ones that don't.

A total of 73233 32x32 pixel pictures were used to train the neural netowrk.
	- 13213 pictures of faces from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ (the images form this dataset were cropped and resized to  fit the 32x32 pixel criteria)
	- 59980 pictures of random objects (32x32) from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
